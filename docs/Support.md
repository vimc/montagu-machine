Host fingerprint (ECDSA): `SHA256:etgLOXa8brU/0SsfYfoFwsNW3ljbkLPd3okPJlICN6A`

## Services

* [TeamCity](https://github.com/vimc/montagu-ci) 
  (via vagrant, installed as a systemd service as `montagu-ci`)
* [Staging](https://github.com/vimc/montagu-machine/tree/master/staging)
  (via vagrant, installed as a systemd service as `montagu-staging`)
* [Docker registry](https://github.com/vimc/montagu-registry) 
  (as Docker container, control from `~montagu/registry`)
* [Vault](https://github.com/vimc/montagu-vault) (as Docker container, control from `~montagu/vault`)
* [Montagu-Monitor](https://github.com/vimc/montagu-monitor) (as Docker container, control from `~montagu/monitor`)
* [YouTrack-Integration](https://github.com/reside-ic/youtrack-integration) (as Docker container, control from `~montagu/youtrack-integration`)


## Users

* The `vagrant` user is needed to control the virtual machines - `science`, `uat`, `latest`, and the CI system.
* The `montagu` user is used to control services that are dockerised (though these can also be controlled from fresh clones in any user's directory)

The passwords for these users are in the vault at `/secret/support/passwords/<user>` (stored under the `value` key), but these should be unnecessary for almost all actions.

## Upgrading and rebooting
### Graceful shutdown
Everything will shutdown gracefully on host system shutdown. The Vagrant VMs
are installed as a service and Docker will automatically stop containers on 
shutdown.

### Upgrade
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo reboot now   # if needed
```

### Resume
All services except the Vault and the YouTrack webhook restart automatically on boot. So you need to:

1. Start Vault: [Instructions](https://github.com/vimc/montagu-vault#restarting-andor-restoring-the-vault)
1. Unseal the Vault: [Instructions](https://github.com/vimc/montagu-vault#unsealing-the-vault)
1. Start the YouTrack webhook: `~montagu/youtrack-integration/run --use-vault`

You can check things are working by:

1. TeamCity: Going to http://teamcity.montagu.dide.ic.ac.uk:8111 and checking 
   that the page loads and that 3 agents are connected.
1. Registry: Running `docker pull docker.montagu.dide.ic.ac.uk:5000/montagu-db:master`
1. Staging: Browsing to the instances: [URLs](https://github.com/vimc/montagu/blob/master/staging/README.md#access-the-stage-instances)
1. Vault: If you were able to unseal it, then it's up
1. Monitor: Go to http://support.montagu.dide.ic.ac.uk:9090/
